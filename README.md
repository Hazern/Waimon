Anime Girl Pokémon ROM Hack (Gen 1–3)
Welcome!
This is a fun side project where I replace Pokémon from Gen 1–3 (because I’m using a Pokémon Emerald ROM) with anime girl characters.
You’re welcome to suggest which anime girls could replace which Pokémon!

🧩 Example
Carvanha → Gawr Gura (normal costume)

Sharpedo → Gawr Gura (bikini version)

⚠️ No explicit NSFW content will be used in this project.
However, fanservice-heavy characters (like bikinis or revealing outfits) are still acceptable — as long as it's within a tasteful and fun context.

🛠 Tools & Process
I use AI-generated images of anime girls.

Then I retouch the images to make them visually suitable for the ROM hack.

💖 Passion Project
This project is made purely out of love and passion — no profit is involved.
If you'd like to support or donate, you're very welcome, but it's completely optional.
Your ideas, feedback, and encouragement mean a lot already. 🙏

📌 Notes
This is a personal hobby project I’m working on while studying at university.

Estimated time to finish: 1–2 years.

Please don’t expect frequent updates — but I’ll keep working on it when I can!

Feel free to leave ideas or suggestions. 😊
