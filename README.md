Anime Girl Pokémon ROM Hack (Gen 1–3)
Welcome!
This is a fun side project where I replace Pokémon from Gen 1–3 (because I’m using a Pokémon Emerald ROM) with anime girl characters.
You’re welcome to suggest which anime girls could replace which Pokémon!

🧩 Example
Carvanha → Gawr Gura (normal costume)

Sharpedo → Gawr Gura (bikini version)
.
⚠️ No explicit NSFW content will be used in this project.
However, fanservice-heavy characters (like swimsuit, maid, bikinis or revealing outfits) are still acceptable. 😜

🛠 Tools & Process
I use AI-generated images of anime girls.

Then I retouch the images to make them visually suitable for the ROM hack.

📌 Notes
This is a personal hobby project I’m working on while studying at university.

Estimated time to finish: 1–2 years.

Please don’t expect frequent updates — but I’ll keep working on it when I can!

Thanks for checking out the repo!
Feel free to leave ideas or suggestions. 😊
